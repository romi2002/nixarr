          nixarr.openssh.expose.vpn.enable is set, but openssh is not enabled
          on your system, so the openssh server is not running. This is probably
          not what you wanted. You can add the following lines to enable it:

          services.openssh = {
            enable = true;
            settings.PasswordAuthentication = false;
            # Get this port from your VPN provider
            ports [ 12345 ];
          };

          users.extraUsers.username.openssh.authorizedKeys.keyFiles = [
            ./path/to/public/key/machine.pub
          ];

          Then replace username with your username and the keyFiles path
          to a ssh public key file from the machine that you want to have
          access. Don't use password authentication as it is insecure!
